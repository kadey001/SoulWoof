# Inspiration
Research has shown that many pets are social creatures that need to have healthy social circles. In our urban society, many pets do not have the ability to interact and play with their peers. This is a very serious situation. A happy pet is a healthy pet and a happy pet results in a happy owner!

# What it does
We want pet owners and pets to be able to network with each other. Ideally, the program will make every client take a survey which will suggest and pair them with the ideal playmates for their pet. Each owner creates a profile for their pet(s). After each playdate, the owners will rate the experience so the bad dogs and the bad owners will get filtered out ensuring a nontoxic environment for the application's users.

# How I built it
We used react for the web framework. Semantic UI for the UI framework. We used firebase for email authentication and firestore for our NoSQL database. For the title tag and the site logo we used GIMP and obtained our images legally from Google.

# Challenges I ran into
Originally we planned to incorporate additional features such as Instant messaging between users that matched as well as a survey feature that would assist owners in finding the ideal playmate for their pet. We attempted to implement Google Vision object recognition to ensure that the pictures uploaded by the users were dogs. We were unable to implement all our ideas due to the time constraints as well as other difficulties. For all of our team members, this was our first Hackathon and our first time using React/any web framework. Some of our greatest obstacles were figuring out how to use asynchronous programming (dealing with Promises) as well as errors raised while trying to access image modules from javascript.

# Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Although we were far from our initial objective we were pleased with the UI design. We felt that our UI was decent, considering that we started from scratch yesterday afternoon. We worked together and communicated in spite of the fact that it was our first Hackathon. We also almost managed to complete the bare bones of our project using a programming language and devtools that we not familiar with at all.

# What I learned
We learned that using React was much more difficult than using other frameworks such as View.js and angular. We also learned how to UI design, using tools such as Semantic UI as well as HTML, CSS, and GIMP. Despite our different experiences, we were able to delegate work relatively effectively, making sure that we were productive and that nobody was distracted/idling at any point.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
